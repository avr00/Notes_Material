# My Notes

My Notes is a note taking app so you never forget anything! I made it with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React & NodeJS) and deployed to Heroku.

### Libraries used (front-end)
 * [react-toastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify) - for creating an awesome toast
 * [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) - for styling the app with Google's material design.
 * [axios](https://material-ui.com/) - for talking to the API
 *
 ### Libraries used (back-end) 
* [mlab](https://mlab.com/) - for hosting our mongoDB.
* [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) - for modeling and connecting our db to the server
* [expressjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) - used for organizing the application into MVC architecture on the server.
